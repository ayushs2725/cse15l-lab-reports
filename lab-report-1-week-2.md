> Remotely Connecting 


We use **Secure Shell (sch)** to securely connect to the remote servers

To connect to remote servers, enter the following command in the terminal of your computer:

**ssh (user_name)@ieng6.ucsd.edu** where (user_name) is the user name assigned to you.

After completing the above step, you will be prompted to enter you password. Note: *The password you enter will not be visible, not even astriks, but it will be registered.*

After you enter your password and press enter/return, you will be logged into the remote server.
